        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the Oven and Prep the Pan</li>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 375°F.</p>
            <li>Make the Graham Cracker Crust</li>
            <p>In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, sugar, and salt.</p>
            <p>Press the crumbs into an even layer on the bottom of the prepared pan. </p>
            <p>Bake the crust for 10 minutes, until set.</p>
            <p>Reduce the oven temperature to 325°F.</p>
            <li>Make the Cheesecake Batter</li>
            <p>In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or beaters, combine the cream cheese, sugar, and flour.</p>
            <p>Add the vanilla, lemon zest, lemon juice, and salt; beat on low speed until just combined.</p>
            <p>Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing on low speed until incorporated, scraping the bowl as necessary.</p>
            <p>Mix in the sour cream.</p>
            <p>Pour the batter on top of the crust.</p>
            <li>Bake</li>
            <p>Set the unbaked cheesecake in a large roasting pan. Pour boiling water into the roasting pan until it comes about one inch up the side of the cake pan. </p>
            <p>Bake until the cake is just set, 1 hour and 30 minutes to 1 hour and 45 minutes. </p>
            <li>Cool</li>
            <p>Carefully remove the roasting pan from the oven and set it on a wire rack. Cool the cheesecake in the water bath until the water is just warm, about 45 minutes. </p>
            <p>Transfer the cheesecake to the refrigerator to cool for at least 8 hours or overnight.</p>
        </ol>
